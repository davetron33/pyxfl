# pyxfl

Is this officially version 2? It's a pretty substantial change. We have classes now! And a lot less crap in the repo. 

PyXFL is a python class that uses the publicly facing XFL api to retrieve player and team statistics and store them into dataframes for easy analysis. 

The code in this repo is meant purely for *extraction* and makes only minimal attempts to transform and normalize data. It is intended to simplify the process of querying the various XFL stat endpoints and make saving large returns of data easy. 

With that said, it's open source. If you wish to pull this into some kind of visualization library, you do you, fam. <3


# FAQ

**What is this?**

An attempt to create a library to query the XFL stats API using python. 

**Why are you doing this?**

Why indeed.

**How do I contribute?**

Gitops. Write code. Open PR. 

**Who are you?**

Space ghost.

**Where do I get an API key?**

Not from this repo, that's for starters.    
If you know a thing or two about [troubleshooting APIs via the browser](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/request_details/index.html), then you're already halfway there.    
If you don't, then treat this repo like a 'CTF'. Wait..that's a terrible idea.

Use this code responsibly.
