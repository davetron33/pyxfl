# pyxfl

Gathering XFL statistics and data from the (probably not intended to be) public XFL api endpoint. This will eventually turn into a python library to query XFL stats.
This is a work in progress. Made by a proud lifelong DC Defenders fan. 

Be gentle.

Be kind. #SHIELDSUP. 

## FAQ:

1. What is this?

See above.

2. Why are you doing this?

Because I wanted to. And the XFL's stats page is kind of basic. And I wanted to see if I could.

3. What do I do with this?

Whatever you want. See also: License.md

4. What's next?
I'm aware things are kind of basic af right now, and the single "fetch_players.py" file is probably jank. I got things to improve this coming up. Feel free to clone or fork. Currently not accepting merge requests (but this will change once I've worked on this some more)
